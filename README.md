A custom 3D-printed Meta Quest headset holder designed to clamp securely to the side of a desk. This setup keeps your VR headset accessible, protected, and off your workspace. The design is optimized for strength, ease of printing, and everyday use. I didn't really see a broad implimentation of a clamp based system for desk mounting so I made one.

Features:
 - Desk-side clamp mount to free up desk surface
 - Meta Quest–compatible hook (Quest 2 / Quest 3 / Quest Pro)
 - Fully printable with standard FDM printers
 - Includes modifiable CAD files for customization
